# Quality control of metagenomic reads using the Read QC module of metaWRAP

The metagenomic samples that will be analized througout this workshop were collected as part of the CABANAnet project "Exploring the Human Gut Microbiome Diversity in Latin America: Focus on Populations at Nutritional Risk." DNA was extracted from stool samples from rural communities in Colombia and Argentina and sent for shotgun sequencing via NovaSeq 6000 (150 bp PE).

Each participant will be responsible for analyzing one sample. The metagenomic samples are provided as compressed FASTA files (.fasta.gz), which serve as input for the Read QC module of metaWRAP.

In brief, this module trims adapters and low-quality bases using Trim Galore (default parameters), removes human contamination with BMTagger using the CHM13 human genome assembly, and generates a visual quality report with FastQC.
